# Learning Process
## 1. What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a method for learning that involves explaining a concept in simple terms as if teaching it to someone else, to identify gaps in understanding.
## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In the TEDx talk by Barbara Oakley, one of the most interesting stories is her personal journey from struggling with math in high school to eventually mastering it and becoming a professor of engineering. She shared how she initially failed her math and science courses, but after realizing how much it limited her career options, she decided to tackle those subjects head-on. Her story is inspiring because it shows that with determination and the right mindset, we can overcome challenges and succeed in areas where we once struggled.
## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
* **Active Mode**: When we are deeply focused on a task, concentrating hard to solve problems or do detailed work.

* **Diffused Mode**: When our mind is more relaxed, allowing us to make connections and come up with creative ideas without intense focus.
## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? 
* **Divide the Skill into Smaller Parts:** Break the skill down into manageable sections and focus on one at a time.
* **Gather Basic Knowledge:** Learn enough about the skill to get started without drowning in too much information.
* **Minimize Distractions:** Remove anything that might interrupt your practice, like silencing your phone or    decluttering your space.
* **Practice for 20 Hours:** Set aside at least 20 hours to practice the skill, working on it consistently to improve over time.
* **Keep Practicing Regularly:** Try to practice a little bit every day instead of doing everything at once. Practicing regularly helps you remember what we have learned and improves our skills over time.
* **Learn from Your Mistakes:** Making mistakes is okay! They help to learn what to do better next time. When we mess up, think about what went wrong and use that knowledge to improve.
## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
* **Explain concepts in simple terms:** Use the Feynman Technique to deepen understanding.
* **Alternate between focused and diffused modes:** Balance intense study sessions with breaks to allow for creative thinking.
* **Apply the 20-hour rule:** Dedicate focused time to practice and learn new skills effectively.
* **Stay disciplined:** Minimize distractions by managing notifications, using productivity apps, and blocking social media during study times.
* **Make learning fun:** Approach new concepts with curiosity, and explain them in our own words to solidify understanding.
* **Set clear goals and deadlines:** Use deadlines to manage time effectively and focus on mastering key skills.
* **Practice teaching:** Regularly explain what we learned to others to reinforce your knowledge.
