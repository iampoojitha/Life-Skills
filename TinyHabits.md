# Tiny Habits

## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

According to the video, the most interesting story was when the speaker talked about how he was able to change his own behavior by creating a tiny habit. He said that he wanted to lose weight, but he didn not want to rely on motivation or willpower. Instead, he created a tiny habit of doing two push-ups after he used the bathroom. This simple habit helped him to lose weight without having to think about it too much.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

According to the video, the formula B = MAP can be used to make new habits easier. Here is what each part of the formula refers to:

- **Motivation (M):** This refers to your desire or willingness to perform a certain behavior. The video emphasizes that relying solely on motivation is not a sustainable strategy for habit formation, as motivation can fluctuate.
- **Ability (A):** This refers to our capability to perform a certain behavior. The video suggests that making the behavior as easy as possible by breaking it down into smaller steps (tiny habits) can significantly increase our ability to perform it consistently.
- **Prompt (P):** This refers to a cue or trigger that reminds us to perform the behavior. The video recommends using action prompts, which link the completion of one behavior to the initiation of the new habit. This helps to create momentum and makes it more likely that we will follow through.

## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

According to the video, the speaker emphasizes the importance of 'Shine' or celebration after each successful completion of a habit. Here's why it's crucial:

- **Boosts Confidence and Motivation:** Celebrating small wins, no matter how tiny, reinforces a sense of accomplishment. This positive reinforcement boosts our confidence and makes you more motivated to repeat the behavior.
- **Creates Positive Association:** When we celebrate after completing a habit, we create a positive association with the action. This positive reinforcement makes it more likely that you'll repeat the behavior in the future.
- **Makes Habit Formation Sustainable:** Celebrating success is key to making habit formation sustainable in the long run. By enjoying the process and feeling good about our progress, you are more likely to stick with our new habits over time.

## 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The video talks about how small changes can lead to big results.
It tells the story of a cycling team that became really good by making tiny improvements in everything they did. The idea is that if we get a little better every day, we can achieve amazing things over time.

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book says it's better to change how we think about ourself than to just change what you want to achieve.
For example, if we want to be a writer, start acting like one by reading, writing, and joining writing groups. Becoming a writer is more important than just writing a book.

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book suggests focusing on becoming the kind of person who would do the habit.
Instead of just trying to do the habit, work on your identity. For example, if we want to be a runner, start thinking and acting like a runner. This makes it easier to actually start running because it fits our new identity.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The book doesn't directly address how to make a habit harder to do. Its primary focus is on building good habits. However, we can infer that making a habit harder involves the opposite approach to building one.
To make a habit harder, you would likely:

- **Remove triggers:** Eliminate cues that remind you of the habit.
- **Increase obstacles:** Make it more difficult or time-consuming to perform the habit.
- **Decrease rewards:** Reduce any positive outcomes associated with the habit.
- **Increase penalties:** Introduce negative consequences for performing the habit.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

**Habit:** Reading more books

- **Schedule reading time:** Dedicate specific time blocks for reading.
- **Keep books visible:** Place books in prominent areas like the bedside table or living room.
  **Make the habit attractive:**

  **Make the habit easy:**

- **Use audiobooks:** Listen to books while commuting or doing chores.
  **Make the reward satisfying:**
- **Track reading progress:**Use a reading journal or app to monitor my reading goals.
- **Join a book club:** Discuss books with others to gain new perspectives.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
